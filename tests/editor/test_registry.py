"""The instrument-registry test gate -- makes drift between the three mirrors
impossible to merge.

The catalog's single source of truth is ``screenbuilder_factory.REGISTRY``
(``InstrumentSpec`` records). These tests assert:

  * every registered instrument is a real, buildable factory type;
  * a migrated instrument is removed from the legacy curated metadata in
    ``editor/schema.py`` (no double definition -> no drift);
  * the exported schema for a migrated type comes verbatim from its record;
  * the widget actually exposes every ``apply="attr"`` property the record
    declares -- so a renamed/typo'd property fails CI instead of silently
    doing nothing on the panel.

See docs/instrument_spec.md and docs/adding_an_instrument.md.
